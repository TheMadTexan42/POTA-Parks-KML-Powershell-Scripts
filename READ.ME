These are Powershell scripts.  They process the CSV park list file provided by POTA into one or more KML files for use with Google Earth and other mapping programs.

No warranty of any kind is provided.  The only guarantee you'll get is that these will be hard to use - if they work at all.

These scripts do not connect to POTA directly in any way, an no modifications to do so are permitted.  
When you do connect to POTA, you do so under the obligation to follow all POTA rules and guidelines.  ANY abuse of the POTA system will not be tolerated and will result
in your immediate loss to all of these resources!
